## Did border closure cause food inflation in Nigeria?
 
In August 2019, the Nigerian government partially closed the country's land borders and, in October 2019, halted all trade via land borders. This policy, which remained in effect until December 2020, was aimed at stopping the smuggling of food items into Nigeria.

Using publicly available data, sleeky data visualization and hilarious story telling, I analysed the causal effects of this border closure policy on food inflation in Nigeria. The Python codes I used for creating the data visuals are available in this repo, while a short blogpost detailing the outcome of my analysis is available at this [link](https://sites.google.com/view/rbbello/portfolio/econometrics-blog/border_closure).
